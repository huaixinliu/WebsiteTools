The Capitol Critics are raving and now, a nation united watches and waits.

By the Capitol Couture staff

Citizens: It has been a breathless, dizzying countdown to today! We introduced you to our courageous Victors, one by one, and saluted their respective Districts. Uber-stylist Cinna unveiled his new scent here and we reported on Panem&rsquo;s widespread influence on the fashion runways. In our profiles, you glimpsed a softer, more carefree side of our heroine Katniss Everdeen and met the sly minx of District 7, Johanna Mason.

For months, we all anticipated this Quarter Quell&mdash;an anniversary year of the Games to commemorate the steadfast hold of the Capitol. Parties and parades delighted us, distracted us. What will you wear to the Games, we asked each other? &nbsp;Where will you sit at the viewing events? Most importantly, who will you champion?

But before we knew it, the day of the Quarter Quell arrived. And like with any once looming monumental event, neither the reality nor the gravity had really resonated. &nbsp;Katniss. Peeta. Effie. Finnick. Haymitch. Cinna. These amazing citizens feel more like intimate family than famous personalities. Katniss, our sister with a heart of steel. Peeta, a pillar of loyalty and devotion. Effie, the hysterical Auntie in eight-inch heels. Cinna, our cousin as cool as an ice floe with tapestry vision. 

Clearly, our forefathers giveth and taketh. We&rsquo;re thankful for the glorious times we shared with Panem&rsquo;s finest. &nbsp;May our Victors strategize confidently and battle with cunning. If they must fall, may it be fast. &nbsp;We, the team of Capitol Couture, are watching the Hunger Games together&mdash;holding hands on the edge of our seats &nbsp;Join us, as we catch fire."></a></div>

The Capitol Critics are raving and now, a nation united watches and waits.

By the Capitol Couture staff

Citizens: It has been a breathless, dizzying countdown to today! We introduced you to our courageous Victors, one by one, and saluted their respective Districts. Uber-stylist Cinna unveiled his new scent here and we reported on Panem&rsquo;s widespread influence on the fashion runways. In our profiles, you glimpsed a softer, more carefree side of our heroine Katniss Everdeen and met the sly minx of District 7, Johanna Mason.

For months, we all anticipated this Quarter Quell&mdash;an anniversary year of the Games to commemorate the steadfast hold of the Capitol. Parties and parades delighted us, distracted us. What will you wear to the Games, we asked each other? &nbsp;Where will you sit at the viewing events? Most importantly, who will you champion?

But before we knew it, the day of the Quarter Quell arrived. And like with any once looming monumental event, neither the reality nor the gravity had really resonated. &nbsp;Katniss. Peeta. Effie. Finnick. Haymitch. Cinna. These amazing citizens feel more like intimate family than famous personalities. Katniss, our sister with a heart of steel. Peeta, a pillar of loyalty and devotion. Effie, the hysterical Auntie in eight-inch heels. Cinna, our cousin as cool as an ice floe with tapestry vision. 

Clearly, our forefathers giveth and taketh. We&rsquo;re thankful for the glorious times we shared with Panem&rsquo;s finest. &nbsp;May our Victors strategize confidently and battle with cunning. If they must fall, may it be fast. &nbsp;We, the team of Capitol Couture, are watching the Hunger Games together&mdash;holding hands on the edge of our seats &nbsp;Join us, as we catch fire."></a></div>

The District 12 escort on her outrageous looks.

by Monica Corcoran Harel

For years, Effie Trinket has stood out in the Capitol for her signature style. Like a couture cupcake, this fashion pioneer cuts a wide swath in her trademark pastel wigs and architectural frocks. Never once has Trinket been spotted in ballerina flats or any comfortable footwear, for that matter. &nbsp;One year, during fashion week, Trinket made headlines when she stormed the runway during a Thom Browne show and literally begged a model to let her try on the sky-high platforms.

But in the past season&mdash;with the Quarter Quell right around the corner&mdash;Trinket has shown that she can outdo herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a celebrity now. She was always a fashion maven too, but I think she feels the pressure to really up her game and show off,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Banks. &ldquo;Effie is someone who wears fur, feathers. She says, &lsquo;Oh a butterfly. I&rsquo;m going to kill it and make a dress!&rsquo; She plunders nature for her own gratification.&rdquo;

Case in point: Her monarch butterfly dress, worn for the Reaping, boasted 10,000 feathers and had to be slipped on to the escort from above because of its structured form and high collar. &nbsp;(What no one knows is that Haymitch Abernathy and Katniss Everdeen fanned Trinket to keep her cool on that warm, sunny day.)

Some of Trinket&rsquo;s other recent flamboyant ensembles? &ldquo;We had names for every dress,&rdquo; Banks adds. &ldquo;One&mdash;the blue with the feather shrug&mdash;was &lsquo;The Gorilla.&rsquo; The belt is incredible too, but there was no eating and barely any sitting in that dress!&rdquo; For her visit to the Victor&rsquo;s Village, the escort wore a white leather laser cut Alexander McQueen with snowy curls and boots trimmed in white fur. Banks calls it &ldquo;The Snow Queen&rdquo; and says: &ldquo;Other than the belt, it&rsquo;s actually comfortable. I&rsquo;m wearing custom fur boots and gloves too. I love this look so much!&rdquo;

Of course, the most celebrated escort understands the rigors of beauty. All of her wigs are hand-created for her in District 1, where real gold/platinum threads and diamond dust are made. &ldquo;The gold wig I wore with the red fans dress was the hardest because it was like fitting architecture to my head,&rdquo; says Banks. With Capitol luminaries Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark as her charges and tours galore, this den mother admits that she sometimes has to make some concessions on her routine. &ldquo;I wear amazing gloves now instead of crazy nails because the nails took 45 minutes to do,&rdquo; she says.

No doubt, the upcoming Games are a cause of great inner conflict for Trinket. Imagine how she must feel, seeing her Victors off to battle. Still, it&rsquo;s inarguable that Effie Trinket will continue to be an utter tornado of chic. &nbsp;From her pink feather faux lashes to her crystal encrusted fishnet hosiery, this Capitol icon will never lose sight of her effect. Says Banks: &ldquo;Effie is a great fashion influence. &nbsp;She lets me be a little wild.&rdquo;"></a></div>

The District 12 escort on her outrageous looks.

For years, Effie Trinket has stood out in the Capitol for her signature style. Like a couture cupcake, this fashion pioneer cuts a wide swath in her trademark pastel wigs and architectural frocks. Never once has Trinket been spotted in ballerina flats or any comfortable footwear, for that matter. &nbsp;One year, during fashion week, Trinket made headlines when she stormed the runway during a Thom Browne show and literally begged a model to let her try on the sky-high platforms.

But in the past season&mdash;with the Quarter Quell right around the corner&mdash;Trinket has shown that she can outdo herself. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a celebrity now. She was always a fashion maven too, but I think she feels the pressure to really up her game and show off,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Banks. &ldquo;Effie is someone who wears fur, feathers. She says, &lsquo;Oh a butterfly. I&rsquo;m going to kill it and make a dress!&rsquo; She plunders nature for her own gratification.&rdquo;

Case in point: Her monarch butterfly dress, worn for the Reaping, boasted 10,000 feathers and had to be slipped on to the escort from above because of its structured form and high collar. &nbsp;(What no one knows is that Haymitch Abernathy and Katniss Everdeen fanned Trinket to keep her cool on that warm, sunny day.)

Some of Trinket&rsquo;s other recent flamboyant ensembles? &ldquo;We had names for every dress,&rdquo; Banks adds. &ldquo;One&mdash;the blue with the feather shrug&mdash;was &lsquo;The Gorilla.&rsquo; The belt is incredible too, but there was no eating and barely any sitting in that dress!&rdquo; For her visit to the Victor&rsquo;s Village, the escort wore a white leather laser cut Alexander McQueen with snowy curls and boots trimmed in white fur. Banks calls it &ldquo;The Snow Queen&rdquo; and says: &ldquo;Other than the belt, it&rsquo;s actually comfortable. I&rsquo;m wearing custom fur boots and gloves too. I love this look so much!&rdquo;

Of course, the most celebrated escort understands the rigors of beauty. All of her wigs are hand-created for her in District 1, where real gold/platinum threads and diamond dust are made. &ldquo;The gold wig I wore with the red fans dress was the hardest because it was like fitting architecture to my head,&rdquo; says Banks. With Capitol luminaries Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark as her charges and tours galore, this den mother admits that she sometimes has to make some concessions on her routine. &ldquo;I wear amazing gloves now instead of crazy nails because the nails took 45 minutes to do,&rdquo; she says.

No doubt, the upcoming Games are a cause of great inner conflict for Trinket. Imagine how she must feel, seeing her Victors off to battle. Still, it&rsquo;s inarguable that Effie Trinket will continue to be an utter tornado of chic. &nbsp;From her pink feather faux lashes to her crystal encrusted fishnet hosiery, this Capitol icon will never lose sight of her effect.

The star-crossed lovers from District 12. &nbsp;Panem&amp;#8217;s sweethearts. &nbsp;Regardless of the titles placed upon them, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have shown unimaginable bravery in the face of almost certain death, with an unwavering devotion to each other that has inspired and brought a country together. &nbsp;

From Peeta&amp;#8217;s startling revelation of love on Caesar Flickerman&amp;#8217;s stage to the moment in the arena they uttered that fateful word, &amp;#8220;together,&amp;#8221; our nation has had the collective honor of watching these two young people grow in their love for each other, and together, they have risen far past their humble District 12 beginnings. &nbsp;

&quot;I can&amp;#8217;t imagine my life without her,&quot; Peeta says, squeezing Katniss&amp;#8217;s hand as they sit in their quarters on the last day before their second Hunger Games. &nbsp;&quot;Katniss is the only reason I&amp;#8217;m alive today, and this time, I&amp;#8217;m going to protect&nbsp;her.&amp;#8221; &nbsp;Katniss is radiant in a a cowl-neck deep green sweater, sitting as close to Peeta as humanly possible. &nbsp;She gives him a sad smile before shooting me a worried look. &nbsp;

<p>"Sorry, I&#8217;m not great with words," she says, shifting the leg that&#8217;s folded underneath her.  "It&#8217;s always been the two of us in this, and… well, he&#8217;s my rock.  We&#8217;ll go into this arena like we&#8217;ve done everything else since this whole thing started&#8212;by each other&#8217;s side."  </p>

A talent emerges with a stunning portrait of Effie.

by Tess Philbin, Director of SOCA

When&nbsp;Capitol Couture&nbsp;teamed with the Salon of Capitol Art (SOCA) to sponsor an art competition, we had no idea what to expect. Of course, our Districts and the city itself have always boasted a large contingent of creative people. One only needs to survey our buildings, public sculptures, local fashion and even landscape architecture that salutes Panem to appreciate the talent.

But with the Quarter Quell upon us, a call for art that celebrates our Games felt imperative. The weeks and months leading up to the event have always been fraught with preparation and celebrations. &nbsp;Every year, new personalities rise to the surface. This year, we wanted to present and preserve an aesthetic memento of this all-important season in Panem. Thousands of entries came flooding in, but we chose one masterpiece to represent the zeitgeist of the Games in this 75th&nbsp;year.

&ldquo;Effie is truly a visual work of art. Only her wardrobe is doused with bright colors,&rdquo; says Melissa Coan, whose bewitching and nuanced portrait of the District 12 escort captivated our esteemed judges. Working in watercolors, pen and acrylics, Coan depicted Trinket in a pensive moment of repose. It sums up a bittersweet moment for an escort whose attachment to Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark is understandable.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe to say that Effie will approve this depiction of her own likeness,&rdquo; says judge and Tumblr Fashion Evangelist Valentine Uhovski. &ldquo;Half Gustav Klimt and half couture inspired, this is on the money.&rdquo;&nbsp;Capitol Couture&nbsp;Editor-in-Chief Monica Corcoran Harel concurs: &ldquo;Through Coan&rsquo;s artistic vision and the eyes of Effie Trinket, we see both the pomp and the gravity of the annual Games. This Quarter Quell, perhaps more than any other Hunger Games, tugs at our loyalty and gives us all pause.&rdquo;

As the Quarter Quell draws closer and closer, our tribute victors are taking full advantage of their new Training Center. &nbsp;While the original center played host to some of the finest competitors to ever step into an arena, our Gamemakers felt that the Quarter Quell was just the occasion to unveil the improved, feature-packed facility that will inspire tributes for decades to come. &nbsp;The new attributes are wide and varied, and include the following: &nbsp;

Advanced weaponry exhibits the durable properties of District 2&amp;#8217;s revolutionary new alloy blend, heavily favored by District 7&amp;#8217;s Johanna Mason; private training footage shows her wielding the center&amp;#8217;s axes with wicked precision. &nbsp;The lighter, industrial-strength metal ensures that our tributes train with weapons as similar as possible to those they will encounter in the Games, giving them that additional edge when it&amp;#8217;s time to traverse the arena. &nbsp;

The layout of the center has been expanded and streamlined for the most efficient training processes, now including several new rooms with isolated functions. &nbsp;Among them, a holographic projection setting simulating opponents of all sizes, each outfitted with different weapons. &nbsp;The holo-opponents utilize motion-capture movement and simulated terrain, approaching the tribute from all angles. &nbsp;We hear District 1&amp;#8217;s Gloss has been spending a good deal of time in this area.

For the first time, carefully-selected Peacekeepers have been assigned to combat training duties, giving the tributes a live opponent to spar with if they choose. &nbsp;Heavily armored and highly skilled in hand-to-hand techniques, these law-enforcement professionals bring their personal training and experience to inspire and aid our tributes. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Given the high-profile status of this year&amp;#8217;s tributes, an added layer of protection has been added for our benevolent Gamemakers, coming and going to observe the training process at their leisure. &nbsp;Details have been highly guarded regarding this implementation, but we can only assume these masters of design have thought of everything necessary for their well-being. &nbsp;
We wish the tributes a safe and informative training period in their state-of-the-art facility, and remain on the edge of our seats for the much-anticipated Quarter Quell. &nbsp;As always, may the odds be ever in their favor, and a very happy Hunger Games to you all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The impresarios sit down and dissect the Games.

by Kaysa Minox


&quot;My favorite line? My absolute favorite? &nbsp;Ever?&quot; Claudius Templesmith&mdash;official emcee of the Games&mdash;leans back in his chair, the sheen of his metallic gray blazer shimmering like the sun on the sea as he shifts. &nbsp;He looks thoughtfully at a rapt Caesar Flickerman, seated next to him with his fingers intertwined beneath his chin in the most serious manner. Templesmith sighs, before stating slowly, and with great emphasis: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.&amp;#8221;

Flickerman&amp;#8217;s manicured hand flies to his chest and flutters gracefully over his heart, as he gushes to Templesmith about the emotion of his delivery that day, while Templesmith manages to appear simultaneously humble and uncannily self-congratulatory. Although Flickerman has held his position for more than Templesmith&rsquo;s tenure, the duo possesses a most unique rapport. Their quick-witted repartee and mutual love for high fashion&mdash;imagine a pair of peacocks in a ring&mdash;leave no question that both of these men are distinct and well-loved fixtures of the yearly Hunger Games. &nbsp;

Each year, these men take us through the ins and outs of the preparation, execution, and follow-up to the Games, acting as our well-dressed windows to the exclusive tidbits and hidden emotions that bring the process to Technicolor life. &amp;#8220;You know, there are so many facets to what we do,&amp;#8221; Flickerman muses. &nbsp;&amp;#8221;We connect with the tributes, certainly, but most importantly, we develop real relationships with the members of our audience&mdash;in the Capitol and in the districts. &nbsp;And I couldn&amp;#8217;t do that without this man right here.&amp;#8221; &nbsp;He pats Templesmith&amp;#8217;s hand, making him beam and blush simultaneously.


&quot;Oh truly, especially with the Quarter Quell nearly upon us!&quot; Claudius exclaims. &quot;And Caesar brings a real passion to his work. He captures the meaning of the Games, the true spirit and necessity of the tradition.&rdquo; Templesmith pats Flickerman&rsquo;s hand. Quid pro quo on the admiration. He smiles wide and says: &ldquo;People know me as the voice of the Games, but Caesar is the heart.&quot; &nbsp;

Reserve your seats to the Quarter Quell! "></a></div>

Although Flickerman has held his position for more than Templesmith&rsquo;s tenure, the duo possesses a most unique rapport. Their quick-witted repartee and mutual love for high fashion&mdash;imagine a pair of peacocks in a ring&mdash;leave no question that both of these men are distinct and well-loved fixtures of the yearly Hunger Games. &nbsp;

Each year, these men take us through the ins and outs of the preparation, execution, and follow-up to the Games, acting as our well-dressed windows to the exclusive tidbits and hidden emotions that bring the process to Technicolor life. &amp;#8220;You know, there are so many facets to what we do,&amp;#8221; Flickerman muses. &nbsp;&amp;#8221;We connect with the tributes, certainly, but most importantly, we develop real relationships with the members of our audience&mdash;in the Capitol and in the districts. &nbsp;And I couldn&amp;#8217;t do that without this man right here.&amp;#8221; &nbsp;He pats Templesmith&amp;#8217;s hand, making him beam and blush simultaneously.


&quot;Oh truly, especially with the Quarter Quell nearly upon us!&quot; Claudius exclaims. &quot;And Caesar brings a real passion to his work. He captures the meaning of the Games, the true spirit and necessity of the tradition.&rdquo; Templesmith pats Flickerman&rsquo;s hand. Quid pro quo on the admiration. He smiles wide and says: &ldquo;People know me as the voice of the Games, but Caesar is the heart.&quot; &nbsp;

Reserve your seats to the Quarter Quell! "></a></div>

Our leader expounds on the importance of the Games.

by Helena Thomas, political correspondent

President Coriolanus Snow smiles benevolently from behind his desk, an island in a sea of resplendent cherry woodwork, upholstered club chairs and walls lined with countless tomes. An antique globe atop a side table is a sly wink to the world, pre-Panem. As usual, he is outfitted in cut velvet, a seemingly soft, delicate fabric with amazing durability. His navy blazer bears his floral trademark&mdash;a delicate white rose on the precipice of bloom&mdash;tucked in his lapel. &ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; he asks.

We shall. It&rsquo;s no secret that the President hasn&rsquo;t spoken one-on-one with a publication in over five years. His press conferences typical take place from his gilded balcony and questions are not encouraged. With the Games beginning this Friday, it&rsquo;s a particular honor for us to steal a moment with him. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know every citizen reads Capitol Couture, so let this interview be my call to the people of Panem,&rdquo; he says, standing up for a moment with his hand at his heart. &ldquo;Are you preparing for the Quarter Quell? It&rsquo;s part of our civic duty to participate and show your loyalty.&rdquo; 
Outside the President&rsquo;s sanctuary, the phone bleats constantly. &nbsp;His desk has its own skyline of paperwork, neat piles of folders, documents and memos. Though his office also boasts the most advanced holograph technology, the President still relies on paper for certain correspondences. &ldquo;I do appreciate the efforts of District 7 and all those glorious trees,&rdquo; he says, referring to the lumber district that still produces creamy, vellum stock exclusively for our leader.

A Capitol native, Coriolanus Snow says that he knew at an early age that he would ascend in politics. His undisputed career proved his loyalty and love for the country, as he quickly rose through the ranks to the apex of power as President of Panem. Our country&rsquo;s CEO has overseen the most prosperous periods in our history. The luxury works coming out of District 1 have never been so opulent. But through it all, he remains a family man and mentor, ensuring that the generations of his house are well and thriving. &nbsp;So how does a man with so many obligations maintain such a relaxed composure and genial nature? &nbsp;
&quot;It&amp;#8217;s very important to relax,&quot; he says with an avuncular smile in his deep but mellifluous voice. &nbsp;&quot;My gardens keep me calm. I stroll through them when I need to ponder important matters or focus on a developing situation.&quot; &nbsp;Indeed, focus is a necessity for planning an event as large as this year&amp;#8217;s Quarter Quell. &nbsp;The President&rsquo;s hand is in every aspect of the preparation process, from arena design to revamping the construction on the Avenue of the Tributes. &nbsp;

&quot;As you know, the rules of the Quells were set in place by the founders of the Games, so I am naturally bound to protocol. &nbsp;My heart goes out to our victors, especially Miss Everdeen,&rdquo; he says. He pauses for a moment, with his gaze aloft. &ldquo;But it is a heart filled with pride for this country and our traditions. &nbsp;I have every faith that the Quarter Quell tributes will serve Panem as they always have&mdash;with loyalty and honor.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


With that said, where will you be seated at the Games? And what will you wear? Be sure to&nbsp;reserve your seats&nbsp;today!

Check out Effie&rsquo;s favorite accessories.


Gaspar Gloves are not for the faint of style. Just ask sartorial sylph Effie Trinket, who rarely makes an appearance without a pair on hand&mdash;literally. &nbsp;Designed by L.A.-based Dorothy Gaspar, these look-at-me accessories nod to old Hollywood glamour but always with a modern wink of detail like flocking, buckles or gold studs. &nbsp;&ldquo;In my Spring 2014 collection, a notable part of the line is composed of sheer and leather gauntlet gloves,&rdquo; says Gaspar, who is a third generation accessories artisan originally from Hungary. &ldquo;It was extremely exciting to put these gloves together because many of the designs took on inspirations from the Hunger Games universe.&rdquo;

Trinket, a Gaspar devotee along with Madonna, Katy Perry and Beyonce, opts for elaborate, couture cuffs on her gloves. (Designer Trish Summerville collaborated with the glove maker on the details.) The strong silhouettes pair perfectly with her couture frocks nipped at the waist and dramatic Elizabethan ruffs. &nbsp;&ldquo;My goal was to inspire iconic visual details that would really bring out Effie&rsquo;s outrageous and outspoken character, as well as create designs within the vein of her costumes,&rdquo; Gaspar tells Capitol Couture.

Ready to take a bold cue from Trinket? A few directions to ponder: Marc Jacobs showed lace-paneled, leather gloves with ladylike blouses and hot pants for fall, while Wes Gordon accessorized mod looks with classic black satin opera gloves. &nbsp;Gaspar&rsquo;s own ready-to-wear collection includes fingerless leather and crocheted driving gloves, opera-length gloves in suede or satin and feather-light sheer creations flocked with gold. &nbsp;The designer even credits our own stylish city as inspiration. Says Gaspar: &nbsp;&ldquo;The citizens of the Capitol have such colorful and vibrant wardrobes.&rdquo; &nbsp;"></a></div>

The Capitol Collection by COVERGIRL brings you patriotic manicures.

by Arabelle Sicardi

&nbsp;
District 10
A life among livestock offers rich inspiration in the form of texture and plumage. Opt for a rich nail scheme of nudes and animal prints done in an unexpected way that would have even Effie Trinket stopping to ask for pointers. Apply COVERGIRL Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Glosses Toasted Almond underneath a fine layer of cut-to-fit bold feathers to remind everyone of your District&rsquo;s animal magnetism. Glue on small jewels for colorful accents and to signify prosperity for all of Panem too. &ldquo;When using hardware like studs or stones, it is best to use a little bit of nail glue to make them stay on longer,&rdquo; advises Yasuda.
&nbsp;
District 5
Go nuclear with your nail art in homage to your District&rsquo;s precious resource and opt for bold, graphic lines and colors. A color block pattern makes a dramatic first impression&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re tippling Champagne at a pre-Games gala or raising your fist for your Victor. &ldquo;COVERGIRL Capitol Makeup Artist Dotti used really cool, vivid color for this makeup look and I wanted the nails to compliment the overall beauty look,&rdquo; says Yasuda of her inspiration. To get the graphic nail, start with your base color and allow to dry, then scotch tape in diagonals and paint your next section of colors and wait for that to dry. Repeat until your nails are as beautiful as the Capitol is all-powerful. (COVERGIRL Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Glosses Grapevine, Eternal Oceans, Constant Caribbean, Flamed Out and Sulfur Blaze were used to create this look.) 
&nbsp;
Disctrict 8
Ombre nails in homage to the luxurious fabrics woven by the textile industry is the natural choice for a loyal citizen. &nbsp;Orange and red are the colors of adventure and victory, so it&rsquo;s a win-win combination. &ldquo;The nail colors that I used for this look contain really fine glitter, so it is easier to create a beautiful ombre effect,&rdquo; says celebrity make up artist Naomi Yasuda, who suggests that you apply two coats of orange and let dry, and then apply the pink color just on the tip of the nail. Finally, dab red polish between the orange and pink to blend the two colors. (COVERGIRL Capitol Collection Glosstinis in Rouge Red, Inferno and Pyro Pink will achieve this nail look.)

&nbsp;
District 6
Vary up the effect on every nail with sleek stripes and alternating shades that signify the motion of trasnportation. To get this look, the Capitol recommends COVERGIRL Capitol Collection Glosstinis in Violet Flicker paired with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Nail Stickers&mdash;a majestic purple and gold color scheme to will your tribute to victory. Achieving this artistic end result is possible en route to the Games via train or aboard a famed hovercraft. Simply wait for the polish to dry and plan the line pattern before applying stickers.

The Capitol Collection by COVERGIRL brings you patriotic manicures.

&nbsp;
District 10
A life among livestock offers rich inspiration in the form of texture and plumage. Opt for a rich nail scheme of nudes and animal prints done in an unexpected way that would have even Effie Trinket stopping to ask for pointers. Apply COVERGIRL Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Glosses Toasted Almond underneath a fine layer of cut-to-fit bold feathers to remind everyone of your District&rsquo;s animal magnetism. Glue on small jewels for colorful accents and to signify prosperity for all of Panem too. &ldquo;When using hardware like studs or stones, it is best to use a little bit of nail glue to make them stay on longer,&rdquo; advises Yasuda.
&nbsp;
District 5
Go nuclear with your nail art in homage to your District&rsquo;s precious resource and opt for bold, graphic lines and colors. A color block pattern makes a dramatic first impression&mdash;whether you&rsquo;re tippling Champagne at a pre-Games gala or raising your fist for your Victor. &ldquo;COVERGIRL Capitol Makeup Artist Dotti used really cool, vivid color for this makeup look and I wanted the nails to compliment the overall beauty look,&rdquo; says Yasuda of her inspiration. To get the graphic nail, start with your base color and allow to dry, then scotch tape in diagonals and paint your next section of colors and wait for that to dry. Repeat until your nails are as beautiful as the Capitol is all-powerful. (COVERGIRL Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Glosses Grapevine, Eternal Oceans, Constant Caribbean, Flamed Out and Sulfur Blaze were used to create this look.) 
&nbsp;
Disctrict 8
Ombre nails in homage to the luxurious fabrics woven by the textile industry is the natural choice for a loyal citizen. &nbsp;Orange and red are the colors of adventure and victory, so it&rsquo;s a win-win combination. &ldquo;The nail colors that I used for this look contain really fine glitter, so it is easier to create a beautiful ombre effect,&rdquo; says celebrity make up artist Naomi Yasuda, who suggests that you apply two coats of orange and let dry, and then apply the pink color just on the tip of the nail. Finally, dab red polish between the orange and pink to blend the two colors. (COVERGIRL Capitol Collection Glosstinis in Rouge Red, Inferno and Pyro Pink will achieve this nail look.)

&nbsp;
District 6
Vary up the effect on every nail with sleek stripes and alternating shades that signify the motion of trasnportation. To get this look, the Capitol recommends COVERGIRL Capitol Collection Glosstinis in Violet Flicker paired with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Nail Stickers&mdash;a majestic purple and gold color scheme to will your tribute to victory.
